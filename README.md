## Probabilistic Quantum Memory

A probabilistic quantum memory is a memory based on the quantum propertiers allowing an exponential storange capacity. It uses entanglement, where each pattern in memory is storaged in a uniform superposition. It was also an retrieval method able to recovery the exactly pattern with an high probability. The objective is to implement all the procedure using the IBM Qiskit Framwork.
